I'm Alasdair/Ali, a PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan's [MDO Lab](http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu).
I'm interested in developing methods that might make high-fidelity MDO (multidisciplinary design optimisation) a practical tool for designing the next generation of highly flexible aircraft.

For example, in my [MSc thesis](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:1a6b5001-d213-40d9-bc2c-5e831eda527d), and the [corresponding conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348242101_Geometrically_Nonlinear_High-fidelity_Aerostructural_Optimization_for_Highly_Flexible_Wings), I expanded the MDO Lab's MACH framework to enable the use of geometrically nonlinear finite element models which are critical for accurately modelling the aeroelastic behaviour of very flexible wings.

More recently, I've been working on a [geometrically nonlinear flutter constraint for aerostructural optimisation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361040097_High-fidelity_Aerostructural_Optimization_with_a_Geometrically_Nonlinear_Flutter_Constraint).

Watch This space for more publications on this research coming soon!
