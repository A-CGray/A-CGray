I'm Alasdair/Ali, a PhD Pre-Candidate at the University of Michigan's [MDO Lab](mdolab.engine.umich.edu).
I'm interested in developing methods that might make high-fidelity MDO (multidisciplinary design optimisation) a practical tool for designing the next generation of highly flexible aircraft.
For example, in my [MSc thesis](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:1a6b5001-d213-40d9-bc2c-5e831eda527d) I expanded the MDO Lab's MACH framework to enable the use of geometrically nonlinear finite element models which are critical for accurately modelling the aeroelastic behaviour of very flexible wings.
